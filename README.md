# ODSC Report 2019

## The Open Data Science Conference (ODSC)

ODSC West is one of the largest applied data science conferences in the world. Speakers include some of the core contributors to many open source tools, libraries, and languages. Focus is on learning about the latest AI & data science topics, tools, and languages from some of the best and brightest minds in the field.

## Summary

ODSC is a technical conference with business tracks focusing on digital transformation and the impact of AI on business systems. Presenters included leaders, researchers and experts from the top technology companies in the world.

Over the past two years, learning sessions have shifted increasingly from traditional machine learning to deep learning and neural networks across domains of image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing.

Also, from 2018 to 2019, there has been increasing focus on transparency or explainability of AI & neural networks.
